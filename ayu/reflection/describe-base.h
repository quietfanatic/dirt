 // This is the interface for describing types to AYU.
 //
 // A type can be described to AYU by declaring a description with the
 // AYU_DESCRIBE macro.  Here's an example of its usage.
 //
 //     AYU_DESCRIBE(myns::MyClass,
 //         attrs(
 //             attr("MyBase", base<MyBase>(), include),
 //             attr("stuff", &MyClass::stuff, optional),
 //             attr("cousin", value_funcs<OtherClass*>(
 //                  [](const MyClass& v){ return v.get_cousin(); },
 //                  [](MyClass& v, OtherClass* m){ v.set_cousin(m); }
 //             )
 //         )
 //     )
 //
 // AYU_DESCRIBE descriptions must be declared in the global namespace.  For
 // non-template types, you should declare them in the .cpp file associated with
 // your class (or a nearby .cpp file).
 //
 // The first parameter to AYU_DESCRIBE is the type name as you wish it to
 // appear in data files.  It's recommended to fully qualify all namespaces even
 // if you have "using namespace" declarations nearby, because the type name
 // will be stringified by the macro exactly the way it appears.
 //
 // All later parameters to AYU_DESCRIBE must be descriptors, which are
 // documented later in this file under various sections.  Some of the
 // descriptors take accessors, which define how to read and write a particular
 // property of an item.  All functions given to descriptors and accessors
 // should be idempotent, returning the same results whenever they are called,
 // or else undesired behavior may occur.
 //
 // It is possible to declare descriptions for template classes, though it is
 // necessarily more complicated.  It requires you to manually specify a
 // function to generate the type name, and the descriptor and accessor
 // functions must be preceded with desc:: because of C++'s name lookup rules in
 // templates.  Also, several of the descriptor and accessor functions must have
 // the "template" keyword added to help out the C++ parser.  See
 // describe-standard.h for some examples of template descriptions.
 //
 // The list of descriptors passed to AYU_DESCRIBE may be empty, in which case
 // the type cannot be serialized or deserialized, but it can still be used with
 // AnyRef and AnyVal, etc.

    ///// ACCESSORS
     // Accessors are internal types that are the output of the functions below.
     // They each have two associated types:
     //   - From type: The type of the item that the accessor is applied to
     //     (that's the type of the AYU_DESCRIBE block you're currently in).
     //   - To type: The type of the item that this accessor points to.
     // Accessors have up to four operations that they support:
     //   - read: Read the value of the child item from the parent item.  All
     //     accessors support this operation.
     //   - write: Write a value to the child item through the parent item.  If
     //     an accessor is readonly, it does not support this operation.
     //   - address: Get the memory address of a child item from the parent
     //     item.  If an accessor supports this operation, various serialization
     //     operations will be much more efficient, and pointers can be
     //     serialized and deserialized which point to the child item.
     //   - reverse_address: Get the memory address of a parent item from a
     //     child item.  This operation is only used for downcasting, and very
     //     few accessors support it.
     // In addition, accessors can take these flags:
     //   - readonly: Make this accessor readonly and disable its write
     //     operation.  If an accessor doesn't support the write operation, it
     //     is readonly by default and this flag is ignored.  If you have an
     //     attr or elem with a readonly accessor, the attr or elem should be
     //     flagged with invisible|optional or invisible|ignored, otherwise the
     //     parent item will not survive a round-trip serialize-deserialize.
     //     This doesn't matter if the parent item is only ever going to be
     //     serialized and never deserialized.
     //   - pass_through_addressable: Normally you can only take the address of
     //     a child item if its parent is also addressable, but if the parent
     //     item's accessor has pass_through_addressable, then instead you can
     //     take its address if the parent's parent is addressable (or if the
     //     parent's parent also has pass_through_addressable, it's parent's
     //     parent's parent).  If you misuse this, you can potentially leave
     //     dangling pointers around, risking memory corruption, so be careful.
     //     This is intended to be used for reference-like proxy items, which
     //     are generated temporarily but refer to non-temporary items.
     //   - unaddressable: Consider items accessed through this accessor to be
     //     unaddressable, even if they look like they should be addressable.
     //     You shouldn't need to use this unless the parent has
     //     pass_through_addressable, or for some reason you're returning
     //     AnyRefs to items with unstable addresses in computed_attrs or
     //     computed_elems.
     //   - prefer_hex: The item this accessor points to prefers to be
     //     serialized in hexadecimal format if it's a number.
     //   - prefer_compact: The item this accessor points to prefers to be
     //     serialized compactly (for arrays, objects, and strings).
     //   - prefer_expanded: The item this accessor points to prefers to be
     //     serialized in expanded multi-line form (for arrays, objects, and
     //     strings).  The behavior is unspecified if both prefer_compact and
     //     prefer_expanded are given, and if multiple accessors are followed to
