 // Like memcmp but only tests equality.  This is faster than a simple
 // byte-comparison loop (which the compiler can't vectorize because it reads
 // variable amounts of memory) and is usually faster than memcmp.
 //
 // Use memcmp instead of this when...
 //   - ...the size is likely to be large.  I haven't measured the threshold but
 //     I'd guess memcmp starts to win at around one or two hundred bytes or so,
 //     possibly earlier if the pointers aren't aligned.
 //   - ...the size is known at compile-time.  If the size is small and known at
 //     compile-time, then the compiler will (hopefully) optimize memcmp into
 //     very small and fast code.
 //   - ...you're suspicious of amateur memory-manipulation code compared to
 //     tried-and-true standard library code.
 //   - ...portability is more important than performance.
 // In other words, use memcmp instead of this. :3
 //
 // Unlike memcmp, you are allowed to pass nullptrs if s == 0.  Most memcmp
 // implementations allow this but the language spec does not.
 //
 // Also, be aware that this returns true on equality and false on inequality,
 // the opposite of memcmp.
